# Adenum CSS Guide

## Credit to SMACSS
Adenum CSS Architecture is from my own experience and thoughts, but SMACSS methodology helped me shape the actual architecture&mdash;its emphasis on good structure, maintainability, modularization, and categorization of CSS code. SMACSS was my favorite CSS methodology among BEM, OOCSS, and SMACSS.

I was roughly developing my own CSS code structure by having these sections in the `style.css` file: `CSS reset`, `common/foundation`, `typography`, `specifics`. Around that period, I think I happened to hear about the SMACSS CSS methodology. I, too, was feeling thirsty for organizing CSS structure. Values SMACSS suggested matched with the values I have been pursuing&mdash;modularization, separated structure, categorization, and maintainability.

Now, I intend to finish writing the Adenum CSS Architecture/Guide document, referring to my own experience and thoughts of building Web Standards-compliant websites from 2007 to present as well as the SMACSS methodology.
